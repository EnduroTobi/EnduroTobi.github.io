## Workflow

The Git-Workflow consists of three stages.

1. Workspace
2. Stage area
3. Repository

## Repository

### Create a repository

```bash
git init
```

### Clone a remote repository

```bash
git clone <url>
```

### Update a local Repo

```bash
git pull
```

## Status

### Show the status of the repo

```bash
git status
```

### Show last commit or commit of a certain revision

```bash
git show HEAD
# or more specific
git show <Hash-code>
```

### Show all commits

```bash
git log
#or for more info
git reflog
```

### Show all branches

```bash
git branch
# press "Q" to quit the view

# show all remote branches
git branch -a
```

### Show all branches in a tree view

```bash
git log --graph -oneline
```

## Branches

Create a branch

```bash
git checkout -b <branchname>
```

### Switch to another branch

```bash
git checkout <branchname>
```

### Fetch and merge the latest changes from the remote repository

```bash
git pull
```

### Compare two branches

```bash
git diff <branch to compare>
```

### Delete a branch

```bash
git branch -d <branchname>
```

## Commit and Merge

### Undo changes in the workspace

If you would like to undo your local changes but can't remeber the original content or you are lazy, use this command.

```bash
git checkout HEAD <filename>
# or use
git checkout -- <filename>
```

### Stage your work

```bash
git add <file>
# or stage all
git add .
```

### Undo the staging

```bash
git reset
```

### Commit to the Repo

```bash
git commit -m <comment>
# or in more detail
git commit -m <main comment> -m <some more info>
```

{: .prompt-tip}

> A good practice is to write your comment in present tense.

If you find a mistake or forgot something in the previous commit but don't want to make a completely new commit use this.

```bash
git add
git commit --amend
```
This replaces your previous commit with the new updated one.

### Undo a commit

```bash
git reset HEAD~1
# 1 = One commit back starting from the head revision
# if you want to go back to a specific revison use
git log
# to see the Hash-code
git reset <Hash-code>
```

Your local workspace still will be unchanged from the reset. So you have to do a checkout for each file.

```bash
git checkout HEAD <filename>
# or use
git checkout -- <filename>
```

### Push the local commit to the remote repository.

```bash
git push <remote branch> <local branch>
```

### Stashing

If you work on branch _A_ and are asked to change something quickly on branch _B_, you can switch branches without commiting or losing your unfinished code on branch _A_.

Create a stash

```bash
git stash
```

Your work now disapears and is saved for later use. You can now switch to another branch and do your work.

Once you are finished with your work and want to resume your work, go to your branch _A_ and use this command.

```bash
# Show all stashes
git stash list

# Retrieve the work
git stash pop
```

For further help you can use the help function.

```bash
git stash -h
```
