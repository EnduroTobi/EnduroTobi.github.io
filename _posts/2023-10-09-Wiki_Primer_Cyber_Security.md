## Malware

### Adware

Adware is used to display pop ups, mostly with advertisment, on your screen. Adware is not directly harmful but can often be bundled with other malware.

### Virus

A virus is a piece of code, that can nest in other parts of your PC and can harmfully alter it.

### Worms

A worm is a harmful piece of code, that is able to self-replicate and to spread.

### Spyware

As the name suggests, it is used to spy on someone. A keylogger can be used to record the keyboard input of the victim and therefore gain access to all kind of sensitive information.

### Trojans

Trojans or Trojan Horses are applications, that disguise themself as trustworthy software.

### Rootkits

Rootkits give the attacker the possibility to have full (hidden) access to the victims computer.

### Ransomware

An attacker gains access to a victims computer and can now block the user's access to the data. The attacker can now blackmail the victim.

### Fileless Malware

It uses legitimate tools and the operating system to perform malicious activities. It hides inside this code and is therefore very hard to detect, even for antivirus software.

### Phishing

Phising is a type of Social Engineering. It is a way of getting information directly from the human victim instead of using code. There are different kind of Phising like "Vishing" (attack via phone) or "Smishing" (attack via SMS). There is also the difference if the attack is a broad mass spam email or a tailored attack on an individual, known as "spear phishing". If this individual is extremely sought after, it is called "whaling".

### Spoofing
Email Spoofing is the act of hiding the attacker's email adress to the victim.
